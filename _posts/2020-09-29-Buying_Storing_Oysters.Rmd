## Buying Oysters from......

![Fearless](https://github.com/madmolecularman/JMG_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/tree/master/images/fearless.png)

### Why Fearless?

Disclaimer: I am in no way connected with this fish market besides the fact that I love the little area that it is in! There is a ramen shop, two taprooms, and some nice automotive shop neighbors so you get that real gritty inner-city vibe. Going here is a treat and you can make a whole afternoon out of it. Just make sure that you get your seafood last, because you may spend too much time eating amazing wagyu ramen or drinking good beers at bayberry (they have great sours)and you seafood will go bad. Here is their **[Fearless Website](https://www.fearlessfishmarket.com/)** for more info.

**Onto the specifics**

They buy direct from fishermen and women in Rhode Island. They purchase fresh seafood every day. They are friendly and have an eye for sustainability. On the sustainability bit here is a statement from their FAQ page: 

> "We try to buy American fish as much as possible. American fisheries are among the best managed fisheries in the world. This is due to the Magnuson Stevens act of 1976. This act was responsible for implementing conservation regulation that helped many fish populations recover and preserved many of those species’ habitats. Our fishery management system has been replicated by many countries worldwide.  It is most certainly not perfect (and arguably too restrictive), but we are confident that US seafood is caught in a way to sustain the fish population and have a low impact on the marine environment. We follow the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) assessments of fisheries worldwide.  We are confident in the FAO’s efforts to collect the best available data to determine the status of global fisheries."

This is to say that when making decisions about how to buy seafood it is important.

### Why is this on your research page?

Well I need to practice storing, shucking, sampling, and extracting DNA/RNA from oysters. Since RI oysters are <1% of their original population, going out and practicing my juvenile lab skills on a declining population isn't my definition of helping the wild ones out. In fact, I think it is a bit morally reprehesible. So as Amy, Maggie, Megan, Jon, and I begin our work through the Puritz lab we need to operate in a way that is considerate of these factors.

### So what did you get?

Oyster type | Location | Grown? | Quantity | Price |
------------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
East Beach Blonde | Ninigret Pond | Bottom Planted | 4 | 1.65 ea |
Sea Kist | Narragansett Bay | Floating Gear | 4 | 1.65 ea | 

Total came out to $13.20. Really not bad for 8 oysters, and they are very good size!

### How are you storing them?

So I looked and looked and looked all over online. There is a bunch of weird info, but the short is in the fridge.

1) I took them out of the bags and checked them to make sure they didn't sound hollow. A hollow sound can indicate a bad oyster. All you neeed to  do is tap it with your finger

2) I briefly washed the outer shell with cold water

3) Placed ice in a tupperware container and poured salt over the ice. The salt will lower the freezing point. More on this later

4) Wet a kitchen cloth and squeezed out so it is damp but not dripping. Placed this over the oysters.

5) Placed in fridge above any meat products

**Caution**

* Oysters should not sit in fresh water. They will die. It is like putting a salt water fish in freshwater. It messes with their osmoregulation, which is sciencey talk for salt balance in their "blood"

* Salt will lower the freezing point for ice so that it does not melt as readily. This can keep the oysters from slipping into the freshwater that will pool at the bottom of the tupperare

* A damp cloth help keep the air around them moist so they do not dry out. Fridges are dry places.

* Do not place them below meat products. You may be clean, but you don't want to mix terrestrial animals juices with ocean animal juices.

### Can you clarify what you are doing with the Oysters?
