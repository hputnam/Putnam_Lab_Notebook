## Buying Oysters from......

![Fearless]()

### Why Fearless?

Disclaimer: I am in no way connected with this fish market besides the fact that I love the little area that it is in! There is a ramen shop, two taprooms, and some nice automotive shop neighbors so you get that real gritty inner-city vibe. Going here is a treat and you can make a whole afternoon out of it. Just make sure that you get your seafood last, because you may spend too much time eating amazing wagyu ramen or drinking good beers at bayberry (they have great sours)and you seafood will go bad. Here is their **[Fearless Website](https://www.fearlessfishmarket.com/)** for more info.

**Onto the specifics**

They buy direct from fishermen and women in Rhode Island. They purchase fresh seafood every day. They are friendly and have an eye for sustainability. On the sustainability bit here is a statement from their FAQ page: 

> "We try to buy American fish as much as possible. American fisheries are among the best managed fisheries in the world. This is due to the Magnuson Stevens act of 1976. This act was responsible for implementing conservation regulation that helped many fish populations recover and preserved many of those species’ habitats. Our fishery management system has been replicated by many countries worldwide.  It is most certainly not perfect (and arguably too restrictive), but we are confident that US seafood is caught in a way to sustain the fish population and have a low impact on the marine environment. We follow the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) assessments of fisheries worldwide.  We are confident in the FAO’s efforts to collect the best available data to determine the status of global fisheries."

This is to say that when making decisions about how to buy seafood it is important.

### Why is this on your research page?

Well I need to practice storing, shucking, sampling, and extracting DNA/RNA from oysters. Since RI oysters are <1% of their original population, going out and practicing my juvenile lab skills on a declining population isn't my definition of helping the wild ones out. In fact, I think it is a bit morally reprehesible. So as Amy, Maggie, Megan, Jon, and I begin our work through the Puritz lab we need to operate in a way that is considerate of these factors.

### So what did you get?

Oyster type | Location | Grown? | Quantity | Price |
------------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
East Beach Blonde | Ninigret Pond | Bottom Planted | 4 | 1.65 ea |
Sea Kist | Narragansett Bay | Floating Gear | 4 | 1.65 ea | 

Total came out to $13.20. Really not bad for 8 oysters, and they are very good size!
