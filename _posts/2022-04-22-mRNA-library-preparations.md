# Goal: To test new adapter solutions with the mRNA hyperprep library kit to achive cDNA libraries

## What did we do?

* Pooled RNA from 12 samples into 9 different pools in 4000 ng/ul concentrations per pool.
* Made new adapters for SAIlV2 and SAIl primers at 7 um working solution
* Confirmed RNA quality and inout into mRNA library preps
* Pool 1, 2, 3 used SaIlV2 adapters and 508/708 primers
* Pool 4, 5, 6 used SaIl adapters and 509/709 primers
* All components warmed to RT
* 80% EtoH made fresh daily
* No cDNA after post-library amplification cleanup
