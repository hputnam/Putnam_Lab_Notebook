## Objective 1a RNA probe pool design and progress

The primary goal for objective 1a in the EAGER project is to test for the effect of probe and gDNA library insert length. This update will cover the synthesis of RNA probes from a group of 12 oysters sampled from 5 location in RI. These pooled RNA samples will be split into pools that have 3 separate lengths: 150, 250 and 350 base pairs.

### Individuals selected for RNA/DNA extraction

A group of 12 individuals was chosen from our sampling of 5 RI sites. Gill tissue was used for DNA/RNA extractions. Location abbreviations were used during this project for selected sites:
* NAR = narrow river
* GHP = Green Hill Pond
* BAR = Barrington
* KIC = Kickemuit
* MCD = Mary C Donovan Marsh

Concentration of DNA/RNA extraction of each individual is listed in the table below.

|Sample|RNA conc. ng/ul|ul. pooled for 333 ng|
|------|---------------|---------------------|
|NAR73|458|0.74|
|NAR83|148|2.28|
|NAR93|146|2.25|
|GHP13|172|1.94|
|GHP23|358|0.93|
|GHP43|362|0.92|
|BAR13|166|2.01|
|BAR23|212|1.57|
|KIC13|311|1.07|
|KIC23|117.5|2.84|
|MCD13|247|1.35|
|MCD23|219|1.52|

### Quality of mRNA library prep pools

These samples were pooled as replicates in pools 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in order to apply them to the early planned gDNA insert pools. This design would change for two primary reasons. 1) Sonication of gDNA samples could not yield peaks defined enough for separation between 250 and 350 insert sizes 2) RNA pools 1, 2, 3 when synthesized through library amplication were of low quality and had issues wiht insert size; primarily due to this being the first library amplification conducted by Finn and myself.

### DSN treatment

Pools 4 - 9 were carried through to duplex-specific nuclease treatment. This process involves a PCR enrichment for 12 cycles which boosts the quantity of the product after the nuclease reduces single stranded genetic product inside of each pool. We also see carry over of the difference in insert size after DSN treatment.

Intially pools 5, 6, 8 did not have a high enough concentration to continue with the pools. We had to complete and additional 6 cycle PCR to amplify the genetic product in these pools to have enough sample to proceed to Probe synthesis.

|Sample|DSN conc. ng/ul|
|------|---------------|
|Pool 4|150|
|Pool 5|278|
|Pool 6|296|
|Pool 7|138|
|Pool 8|284|
|Pool 9|165|

While we don't have tapestation results of post DSN treatment we do have results from the MBN treatment which are the initial steps in probe synthesis.

### Probe synthesis

This brings us to the questionable finish of the RNA probes. For probe pools 4, 5, 6 we had no issue through this part of the synthesis retaining size and retaining good concentration to carry through to hybridization. Pools 7, 8, 9 are a different story. We saw a very reduced concentration and near obliteration of insert size. We attempted another probe synthesis where we achieved good concentration for Pool 7 and 8 but questionable size. Once again Pool 9 did not retain its concentration. After another attempt we now have enough probes for Pool 9 but the size is still questionable

The options we see forward are the following:

1) Use only pools 4, 5, 6 as technical replicates for the 150 and 350 gDNA insert size
2) Use all pools but have technical replicates as a cross for both gDNA pools
3) Use only pools 4, 5, 6 for gDNA insert 150 or 350 and pools 7, 8, 9 for gDNA insert 150 or 350
