List of Course Goals

## Time Management
* Better manage my time this semester despite being remote once again.
* Be sure to write down what I need to get done and their due dates.

## Comfortable with Coding
* Try my best to get the hang of using coding applications such as GitBash and supporting programs such as Atom.

## Gaining a Greater Understanding
* Overall, I really just want to learn as much as I possibly can about the world of Biomedical Research before graduating out into "the real world".
