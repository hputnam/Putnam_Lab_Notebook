## Oyster DNA Sonication Part 1

**Goal:** To test 2 amplitude and 3 timepoint settings for sonicating DNA. I am attempting to achieve the 150-180, 250-270, 350-360 bp DNA fragments for integrating them into the EecSeq protocol and meet objective 1a.

**Results:** So today was kind of a mess, but a beautiful mess. Sonication is a messy business. Who thought breaking up DNA with sound would basically be like magic. There are a lot of specifics for each individual type of DNA sample. My biggest mistake was not normalizing for concentration. In the eecSeq protocol we use 500 ng total in solution. I was honestly more worried about the volume in the sonication tube and did find that there is very much a lower limit that you can have in these tubes to make it viable

**Conclusion:**
