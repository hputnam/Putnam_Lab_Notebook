## Welcome to this Open Lab Notebook!

My name is Jacob Green, and I am a graduate student in the [Puritz Lab of Marine Evolution and Ecology](https://www.marineevoeco.com/) at the [University of Rhode Island](https://www.uri.edu/) in the [Evolution and Marine Biology Program](https://web.uri.edu/cels-gradprograms/bes/emb/). This is honestly my second attempt at keeping a lab notebook. My first year was spent fumbling around and figuring out how to acclimate and let me tell you it isn't easy. Especially, when you move across the country (from California, not the beachy part, the stinky cow part). 

I occupy a few learning spaces at URI. In [VOICES](https://celsvoicesuri.weebly.com/) I am a contributing member at a part of the planning committee. Through [MARC](https://web.uri.edu/marc/), I function as a coordinator creating undergraduate research curriculum to support these awesome researchers. I am actively developing seminars in understanding how we at URI can create research environments that are Just, Equitable, Diverse, and Inclusive (JEDI). 

So this is my second attempt. This is my shining moment to be a good graduate student. This is where I can catalog my thoughts, errors, triumphs, tribulations, and whatever nonsense I can articulate. I hope it helps you on your way too. As always, please feel free to reach out to me at anytime. 

Cheers, 

JMG
