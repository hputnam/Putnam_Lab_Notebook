## Its a gel type of day

By that I mean everything is slow. It is cold here in RI which makes everything slow down. The people, the busses, the protocols even.

Goal: To run 16 Oyster DNA practice samples on an electrophoretic gel and analyze fragment lengths for further sonication practice and optimization

Prep:
1) Clean and wipe down working area
2) Review and write down gel protocol
3) Thaw DNA samples & Ladder

Samples used: 

 Sample | Amt. Used |
--------|-----------|
AA002 M1| 5 ul |
AA002 G1| 5 ul |
AA003 M1| 5 ul |
AA003 G1| 5 ul |
AA006 M1| 5 ul |
AA006 G1| 5 ul |
AA005 M1| 5 ul |
AA005 G1| 5 ul |
AA007 M1| 5 ul |
AA004 G1| 5 ul |
AA008 M1| 5 ul |
AA008 G1| 5 ul |
AA006 M3| 5 ul |

AA008 M3| 5 ul |
AA005 G1| 5 ul |

#### DNA gel protocol

1. Determine the size gel you need to make, remember to account for at least one well for a ladder on each row:
    - Medium gel comb capability: two combs with 20 wells each, total 40
2. For the medium box make a 100mL mix.
3. Making gels:  
   For a **1% gel**
    - **Med box**: 100mL new 1X TAE buffer and 1g agarose 
4. Use a weigh boat designated for agarose and a scoopula to measure agarose and using the graduated cylinder from the gel bench to measure 100 ml 1X TAE
5.	Mix inside the Erlenmeyer flask: add the agarose by taco-ing the weigh boat and carefully pouring the powder as to not get it stuck to the side of the flask. Pour 100 ml new 1X TAE. Swirl the flask to mix
6.	 Put a scrunched Kimwipe in the mouth of the flask and put in the microwave for 1 minute. Every 20 seconds open microwave and swirl flask. Use an orange glove because glass gets hot. Took me 1:30 secs. Was very hot though but no agarose flecks were left in solution
7. 1μl GelGreen to the liquid and swirl the flask to mix thoroughly. **GelGreen is preferred**. Had to make new 3:1 diluted gelgreen. 1 ul of concentrate and 3 ul of H20
8. Set up gel cast mold, place your tray in the gel box sideways and make sure there is an air-tight seal with the rubber noodles. Add water to the rubber "bands" to allow the gel casing to slide in better. Also do not push the gel tray to the bottom, leave some room to lift the tray with your fingers. Use the level to make sure the tray is sitting level inside the box for a flat gel
9. Let gel mix cool ~10 minutes in the flask before pouring into the gel tray, if you can safely hold it, that's a good sign it's ready
10. Pour in the mix and put desired comb size into the tray
11.	Using a pipette tip, move any bubbles to the side of the tray
12.	Let harden until opaque and cool ~30min
13.	Take out and orient the gel with the comb side to the top of the box. Take the comb out of the hardened gel
14.	Pour enough “used” TAE buffer into the gel box to cover the gel with a thin layer of liquid and make sure there are no dimples where the wells are
15.	Add 3 μl of the appropriate ladder to the first well in the gel
16.	On a piece of parafilm, make dots of 1ul of loading dye for each one of your samples. 1 by 1 for each of your sample aliquoits, add 5ul of sample DNA to the dot of loading dye and pipette to mix. It will stay in a bubble on the parafilm. Then suck up the full 6ul and add it to the gel
17.	Make sure you have made a map in your notebook that shows the order of samples

**Sample order from left to right**

* Ladder
* AA002 M1
* AA002 G1
* AA003 M1
* AA003 G1
* AA006 M1
* AA006 G1
* AA005 M1
* AA005 G1
* AA007 M1
* AA004 G1
* AA008 M1
* AA008 G1
* AA006 M3
* AA003 G3
* AA008 M3
* AA005 G1

18.	Make sure gel box is set up to “run towards red” meaning when you slide the lid on, the red electrode will be at the bottom of the box and the gel comb wells are at the top
19.	Plug black cable into black insert and red cable into red insert of the gel power station and gently slide the lid onto the box
20.	Turn box on and make sure voltage is set to 100V. Set time for 60min
21.	Once done, set up the imager. Take the grey imager down from the shelf and remove the orange cover. Also take down the black imager shade and the small orange slide for imaging
22. Slide your gel from the tray into the center of the blue square on the imager
23. Place the black imager shade over the gel and the square and put the orange slide tile over the whole on the top
24. Turn on the light and place your phone camera on the orange square so you can take a picture of your gel through the filter
25. Once you are done with your gel, slide it off the imager and into the large black bucket in the cabinet under the gel bench. This is a non-hazardous waste container for only agarose and TAE
26.	Pour the leftover TAE from the gel box into the used TAE container using the funnel kept on the gel bench
27.	Rinse the gel box, comb, tray, and flask in DI type II water
28.	Wipe the imager with a Kimwipe and DI type II water
29. Return all the materials you have used to where you found them

#### Thoughts on sonication protocol

I want to test different times and amplitudes for sonicating Oyster DNA. There are a few protocol on the Qsonica website that outline test that alter the amplitude and time. Essentially, amplitude should give more defined peaks, and the longer you run it for the smaller the peaks get (to a certain point ~150 bp). But it seems that there is variation between types of tissue and its species. What we want are 180, 270, and 360 bp peaks. We can simplify this to 150, 250, 350 peaks. To test:

| Amplitude | 10 min | 15 min | 20 min | total samples (ladder inlcuded) |
------------|--------|--------|--------|---------------------------------|
25% | 2 | 2 | 2 | 7 |
35% | 2 | 2 | 2 | 7 |
40% | 2 | 2 | 2 | 7 |

In this framework we can run a Tapestation fragment analyzer for each test. Our goal here is to get more defined peaks at each desired fragment length. As of right now we know that 25% provides a broad peak at the desired locations. If we would like to further stabilize and reinforce the peaks of different DNA fragment lengths.
